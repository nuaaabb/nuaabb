* History:
*   12/18/07 - original (D. Alter)
* Notes:
*  1) The section "passwords" contains the actual CSM passwords that get
*     linked to the CSM password locations in flash.  The user must know
*     what these passwords are in order to unlock the CSM.
*  2) Link the section "passwords" to the memory PASSWORDS on page 0.
*  3) It is recommended that all passwords be left as 0xFFFF during code
*     development.  Passwords of 0xFFFF are dummy passwords, and do not
*     lock the code security module (Dummy reads of CSM PWL registers
*     will unlock the CSM).  When code development is complete, the user
*     can modify the passwords to activate the code security module.
*  4) The section "csm_rsvd" is required when using code security.
*     Failure to program addresses 0x33FF80 through 0x33FFF5 in the
*     flash to all 0x0000 can compromise security.  This is documented
*     in the F2833x datasheet, SPRS439.
*  5) Link the section "csm_rsvd" to the memory CSM_RSVD on page 0.
